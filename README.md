# simpwire

## What is this?
A small and simple TCP library.

## How to use
Currently this library is so small that the
easiest way to use it is to just to take the
headers and ccp files from the src directory
and directly insert them into your project.

##Demo
In the demo folder there is a file demo.cpp 
which demonstrates how to use simpwire. It
can be compiled by executing make inside
the folder demo_build.
